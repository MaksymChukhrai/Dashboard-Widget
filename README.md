# Financial Dashboard Widget with US Stock

## Project Description
**Project Objective:** Create graphs displaying real-time stock prices.  
Implemented **three graphs** for **Microsoft, IBM, and Nvidia** stocks, with the current price and percentage change displayed separately under each graph.  

The project code is written in **JavaScript** using the **React** library.  

## Start the Project
You can view the project on GitHub by visiting [this GitHub Page](https://maksymchukhrai.github.io/Dashboard-Widget/).  

## Data for Graphs
Data is obtained in two ways:  
- For **Microsoft and Nvidia** stock graphs, data is fetched from the local file `'src/data/stock_mkt_time_data.json'` as per task requirements.  
- For the **IBM** stock graph, a free **[public API "Daily Time Series with Splits and Dividend Events"](https://www.alphavantage.co/query?function=TIME_SERIES_DAILY_ADJUSTED&symbol=IBM&outputsize=full&apikey=demo)** is used to fetch data in JSON format.  

## Alphavantage API Keys
The **free API keys** provided by Alphavantage allow only **up to 25 requests per day**. Since our project has **three graphs**, this means approximately **(25/3 â‰ˆ 8) website loads** before the data transmission stops.  

The **demo API key** only works for **IBM stock statistics** and does not allow selecting specific data sections via URL parameters. Therefore, **data extraction is handled directly in the code**.  
The relevant file is located at `'src/components/AppleGraph.jsx'`.  

> **Note:** The file is named **AppleGraph.jsx**, but **Apple stock data is not available** through the demo API.  

Due to this limitation, **API requests are used only for the IBM stock graph**.  
The library used for API requests:  
`json`
`"axios": "^1.6.8"`

Since data for Microsoft and Nvidia graphs is imported directly from the local file `src\data\stock_mkt_time_data.json`, they do not require an API key.

## Formulas
Calculation of percentage change in stock price compared to the previous analogous period is done using the following formula:  

$(X_2 - X_1) / X_1 * 100%$, where  
$X_1$ - 'close price' of the stock at the end of yesterday (or an analogous period, e.g., last week)  
$X_2$ - 'close price' of the stock at the end of today.  

The formula answers the question of how much the stock price has changed compared to the analogous period (+/- %).

## Rendering Graphs
The library used for rendering graphs is **"react-chartjs-2": "^5.2.0"**.  
Configuration of the library for each graph is done in respective graph files `AppleGraph.jsx`, `MicrosoftGraph.jsx`, `NvidiaGraph.jsx` (hereinafter referred to as "graph files").

## Hooks and State Management
All graph files use state hooks (`useState`) and effect hooks (`useEffect`) to track current price and percentage change of stocks.  
For example, for Microsoft and Nvidia stocks:

1. First, states are defined (`useState`):
   - `currentPrice` - to store the current price.
   - `percentageChange` - to store the percentage change in price.
2. Then, an effect is used (`useEffect`), which runs on component mount (empty dependency array `[]`).
   - Inside the effect, the current price (`latestPrice`) is calculated as the last element of the stock price array.
   - The initial price (`openPrice`) is also defined as the first element of the stock price array.
   - After calculations, new values for `currentPrice` and `percentageChange` are set using `setCurrentPrice` and `setPercentageChange` functions, respectively.

This approach allows dynamically updating component states based on data from the JSON file, providing up-to-date stock price information on component load.

## Data Loading and Error Handling
When loading data in the component `src\components\AppleGraph.jsx` (IBM graph data), an animated spinner is displayed, which turns off when data is loaded and the graph is rendered.  
In case of server failure and inability to load data into the graph, the user sees an alert window with a message about this. Also, a message about this is passed to the browser console.

## Responsive UI/UX and Creativity
The project design is inspired by the US newspaper [FINANCIAL TIMES](https://www.ft.com/). Corresponding colors and fonts are used.  
The layout is designed for mobile, Tablet PC, and PC devices for breakpoints **min-width 360px, 768px, 1400px** respectively.  
CSS files for styling are located in the `src\css` folder.

## Jest Testing
Testing libraries used:
- **"jest": "^27.5.1"**

To configure testing:
- **"babel-jest": "^29.7.0"**
- **"@testing-library/jest-dom": "^5.17.0"**
- **"@testing-library/react": "^13.4.0"**
- **"@testing-library/user-event": "^13.5.0"**

Testing of the spinner functionality during data loading via the open API for IBM statistics is done. To run testing, execute the command `npm test` in the console. Test file is `src\components\AppleGraph.test.jsx`.  
Below is an example of test results.
